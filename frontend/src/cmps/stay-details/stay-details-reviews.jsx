      Mashari October 2022 Mashari Amazing camping experience Great location
      only 19 minutes driving from the nearest town. Definitely a car is a must!
      Try to check the weather before booking cause I wasn’t able to use the
      grill nor sit outside which would have completed the wonderful experience.
      3 hours from the airport, you will be using a ferry back and forth but the
      charges will be paid by the rental office and deducted out of your
      deposit. This is A Unique 1! Show more Ashley October 2022 Ashley This was
      an incredible experience! Worth every penny! The bed was big and comfy, it
      was warm inside the box and cozy. A few things to know: it is on a working
      farm with lots of sheep so you will need good footwear because there is
      poop all over the path. There’s about a 200 meter trek to the box and the
      last bit is pretty steep so try not to bring too much stuff with you when
      you go. They do have a fire pit and supply wood as well as a sterno for
      coffee. There is also a flushable toilet which is nice! This is glamping
      at its finest! Show more Emmie October 2022 Emmie Wow! Stunning views,
      just like the pictures (or maybe even better!). Comfortable bed and a very
      cozy hide-away. The bathroom in the nearby barn only has the basics (a
      toilet, no running or warm water). A few cooking supplies can also be
      found in the barn, but don't expect to be able to cook a full meal (bring
      some quick and easy food with you). The walk from the parking is short,
      but steep. Bit pricey, but definitely worth it for a special stay! Show
      more Nicole October 2022 Nicole Love our stay at the birdbox! It was cosy
      and comfortable. Matthias October 2022 Matthias Amazing view in a great
      place!!! Chris October 2022 Chris Amazing views and relaxation at Birdbox.
      Would recommend to any couple looking to get away for a one of a kind
      “glamping” experience in Norway. Show all 303 reviews
