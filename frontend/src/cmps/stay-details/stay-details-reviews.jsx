Amazing camping experience Great location only 19 minutes driving from the nearest town.

Definitely a car is a must! Try to check the weather before booking cause I wasn’t able to use the grill nor sit outside which would have completed the wonderful experience.

3 hours from the airport, you will be using a ferry back and forth but the charges will be paid by the rental office and deducted out of your deposit.

This is A Unique 1!

This was an incredible experience! Worth every penny! The bed was big and comfy, it was warm inside the box and cozy.
A few things to know: it is on a working farm with lots of sheep so you will need good footwear because there is poop all over the path. There’s about a 200 meter trek to the box and the last bit is pretty steep so try not to bring too much stuff with you when you go.
They do have a fire pit and supply wood as well as a sterno for coffee.
There is also a flushable toilet which is nice!
This is glamping at its finest!

Wow! Stunning views, just like the pictures (or maybe even better!). Comfortable bed and a very cozy hide-away. The bathroom in the nearby barn only has the basics (a toilet, no running or warm water). A few cooking supplies can also be found in the barn, but don't expect to be able to cook a full meal (bring some quick and easy food with you). The walk from the parking is short, but steep. Bit pricey, but definitely worth it for a special stay!

Amazing views and relaxation at Birdbox. Would recommend to any couple looking to get away for a one of a kind “glamping” experience in Norway.
